CHANGELOG

**REMINDER**
  It is ALWAYS good practice to “copy” your profile before makeing any major changes


3-19-25

** Legacy/Romaen’s limb users, can now toggle the use of this system with iamrome or turn: ak.limbs.sync_enabled = false, to true in the SlyvLoad script (untested as I use ak’s limbs)

** made changes to defaults  and their usage to properly use them

** added swing staff to thorn portion of weaving’s attack

** changed some of the queing stuff to freestand instead of eq/eqbal

** moved anorexia for weathers qlock to before stupidity 

** added restoration salve logic to heartseed

** changed the way the fulmination stuff is queued 

** fixed prepend’s to be less spammy and add things to queue under certain conditions

3-6-25

** Re-worked Limb Selector, to prepare better for Heartseed?

** Reordered Thorn afflictions and adjust some of the class stuff (needs more)

** Fixed heartseed to apply before torso is broken, not after

** Added in "AutoAssist"

** Fixed prefix in scripts and  added prepend

** Bees managment fixed? (Definitely not as well as I hoped, but suitable for now)

*** fix notes about thrLL (not fixed)
